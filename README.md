**Overview of the project**

Project:FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN.

Objective: The objective of this task is to Design FSMs using Verilog or VHDL in the VLSI software environment and write testbenches to test different states and transitions of the FSM. Simulate the FSM behavior and verify its correctness.

Keypoints:

Inputs: clock

Output: light

Verilog module defines a finite state machine(FSM) that is cyclic lamp where the state changes from RED --> GREEN --> YELLOW --> RED

State : COLOR

s0    : RED

s1    : GREEN

s2    : YELLOW

The behavior of synchronous sequential circuits can be represented in the graphical form and it is known as state diagram.
Asynchoronous sequential circuit is also called as FINITE STATE MACHINE(FSM). if it has finite number of states.

There are two types of FSMs.

1.Moore state machine: A Finite state machine is said to be Moore state machine, if outputs depend only on present states.

2.Mealy state machine: A Finite state machine is said to be Melay state machine, if outputs depend on both present inputs and present states.
