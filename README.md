Inputs: clock

Output: light

Verilog module defines a finite state machine(FSM) that is cyclic lamp where the state changes from RED --> GREEN --> YELLOW --> RED

State : COLOR

s0    : RED

s1    : GREEN

s2    : YELLOW

FSM can be developed in two models
1.Moore state machine: Here the ouput is the function of present state only
2.Mealy state machine: Here the output is the function of present state as well as inputs
